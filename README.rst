pmxterm
=======

Unlike the older pyqonsole this console widget works with PyQt4 and let's you
embed a shell into your application. 

See *docs/usage.rst* if you want to know how to use this widget. To test
the widget you can execute *demo.py*.

The vt100 terminal emulation code is based on AjaxTerm and WebShell.
All the code in terminal widget, procinfo and backend is based on pyqtermwidget
from Henning Schroeder more info in https://bitbucket.org/henning/pyqtermwidget.
